# Kahoot AI

This is an extension that will get the question, google it, and then automatically figure out the answer.

This extension was made as a fun challenge and currently does work. There are alot of limitations and you may need to put in a custom serpapi api key but other than that its fine. I am going to work on making it a bit more user friendly and fix alot of bugs.


## Currently known bugs:
- Math equations and other special text breaks the bot
- Can only work when the question is displayed on page (nothing I can do about that)
- Right now can only use answer boxes but I will be updating within a few days


This is only tested on firefox and is not guaranteed to work on other browsers
